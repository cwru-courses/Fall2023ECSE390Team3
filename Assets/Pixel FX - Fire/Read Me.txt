FX DETAILS

Buff

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 16
- Loop: No 
- Details
	- This buff will imbue your armor with fire attribute which may render you immune to fire skills. Up to you.
	- The last frame (the flame over the head) is meant to follow the player around to indicate when the skill is active and when it expires.


Fire I

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 15
- Loop: Yes 
- Details: 
	- This is the most basic fire attack.
	- It will only deal damage to the first enemy it touches.
	

Fire II

- Animations: 6
- Frames: 126
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- There are a total of 4 orbs that circle you.
	- Each orb is its own animation and the best way I can think of to use the sprites is by summoning the 1st orb
	- Waiting x amount of seconds, summoning the 2nd orb and so on until you summoned all 4.
	- This way when an enemy touches you all you have to do is disable the orb that was consumed.
	- Another way to use this is by making a script that will make things move in a circular motion and once the orbs are summoned they will travel the path the script dictates.


Fire III

- Animations: 4
- Frames: 47
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- Create a huge fire hand and smack your enemies to the ground. 
	- That will deal the enemy damage once, and the flames that the hand summons will deal further damage.
	- By the way the hand can be looped to keep smacking your enemies.


Bomb

- Animations: 2
- Frames: 21
- Loop: Yes 
- Details: 
	- This is a bit slow to travel but once it hits your bomb will implode and then explode dealing a vast amount of damage to enemies around the point of impact.
	- Maybe you can also add a high % of knockback to show the big explosion.


Incendiary

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 16
- Loop: Yes 
- Details: 
	- This will 100% guarantee your enemies to get burnt. 
	- For even more insane damage... all you have to do is just spam the skill, loop the animations and hold it down until you run out of MP.


Meteors

- Animations: 5
- Frames: 55
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- These will deal massive amounts of damage based on how long your meteor shower is!
	- The animations have been made in a way that the meteors will travel diagonally towards the floor.


Napalm

- Animations: 3
- Frames: 23
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- Lure your enemies to burn themselves.
	- It is good to know that the 1st animation and 3rd animation can be used by themselves.
	- If you do not want to mix and match just use all 3 animations in a row.

Burn Debuff

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 18
- Loop: Yes 
- Details:
	- Feel free to put them on top of the enemy or below like I have showcased in the previews. 
	- For better results I recommend making the victim red!
	- This debuff can be applied to all fire attacks if you wish.
